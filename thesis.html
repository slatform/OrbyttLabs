                    Orbytt Labs backs overlooked, early-stage opportunities with asymmetric upside. We invest where others aren't looking, guided by conviction rather than consensus. Our approach is simple: find what's non-obvious today but will be obvious in hindsight, and commit capital early.

                        <p class="principle-description">
                            We're not looking for marginal improvements or incremental returns. We seek opportunities where the downside is capped but the upside is exponential. This means being comfortable with uncertainty and patient with timelines when the risk-reward profile is compelling.

                        <p class="principle-description">
                            The best opportunities are those that seem inevitable in retrospect but contrarian in real-time. We invest before the narrative crystallizes, when information asymmetry is highest and when being early creates durable advantages.

                        <p class="principle-description">
                            We back founders who possess unique insight into the problem they're solving. This often comes from lived experience, domain expertise, or a contrarian perspective earned through deep work. The right founder in the right market can overcome nearly any obstacle.

                            We're optimizing for outcomes that compound over years and decades, not quarters. This means supporting companies through market cycles, doubling down on winners, and maintaining conviction even when short-term signals are noisy.

                <div class="stage-content">
                    <p class="stage-description">
                        We typically invest at the earliest stages of a company's lifecycle—often pre-seed, seed, or early Series A. At these stages, capital is scarce, information is limited, and the opportunity for asymmetric returns is highest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stage-description">
                        Our investments take various forms depending on the situation: equity, tokens, SAFTs, or other instruments that align us with long-term success. What matters is structural alignment with founders and the conviction behind the opportunity, not the specific legal wrapper.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stage-description">
                        We're flexible on check size and ownership, but we're inflexible on conviction. We don't make investments to fill a portfolio or hit deployment targets. Every investment must clear a high bar for long-term potential.
