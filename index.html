                        <p class="pillar-description">
                            We invest at the earliest stages, often before consensus forms. This is where information asymmetry is highest and where patient capital can generate outsized returns. We're comfortable with uncertainty when conviction is strong.

                        <p class="pillar-description">
                            We don't spray and pray. Each investment represents a deeply researched, high-conviction thesis about the future. We commit meaningfully to opportunities we believe in, and we're prepared to be early.

                            We seek opportunities with limited downside and exponential upside. Our goal is to find the non-obvious bets that can compound into category-defining outcomes over time.
